1. Project Title / Headline
Pizza Sales Analytics: A Comprehensive Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive visualization dashboard built to uncover key sales trends across various pizza types. This dashboard helps identify best- and worst-performing pizzas, monthly and quarterly sales patterns, and peak pizza purchasing hours ‚Äî supporting better business decisions and growth strategies.

2. Project Description
A deep insight was drawn from the pizza order data, including variables like pizza category, order time, order day, and pizza varieties.
Data cleaning and transformation were performed in MS Excel to derive raw insights and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs).
Trend interpretations were executed using MySQL, where SQL queries extracted insights on daily, weekly, and hourly order trends, category-wise sales, and the top-performing pizzas.
These insights were visualized using various charts and slicers to build a real-time, dynamic dashboard for Pizza Sales.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

üìä MS Excel ‚Äì Main data visualization platform used for dashboard creation

üßÆ MySQL ‚Äì Used for querying, trend analysis, and aggregations

üìÇ SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) ‚Äì For executing and managing SQL queries
